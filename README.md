# Pre-Alpha Development

This branch is for the eventual release of the alpha phase of my Application.

## Objective
The goal is to release a usesable application, with basic features and working functionality.

This will be released to a few streamers to get feedback on:
- Performance (of the application, or whilst streaming/gaming)
- User Experience
- Any more features they'd like added to the application.

## Running the Application
The application will be packaged using PyInstaller.

Flask will host the React Files, and also will make the API Calls. 

Python will be used to manage the SQL Database.

With PyInstaller, the user should be able to run the executable to install the program. Then clicking the Application should run it, allowing them to authenticate and create clips.
